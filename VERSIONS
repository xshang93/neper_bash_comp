New 1.0.0-3 (27 Jan 2022)

Added support for -load* and -load* appearing as the second world of a command.
This is the last version to be updated in a stand-alone repo. Later versions will 
be updated directly in neper.

New 1.0.0-2 (20 Jan 2022)

Changed autocompletion so that two options will not be auto completed in series.

e.g. 'neper -T -n <tap>' will get you a list of file/directory names, not a new option.

New 1.0.0-1 (19 Jan 2022)

Added support for file name completion after options:
-loadtess -loadtesr -loadpoint -checktess  -loadmesh -loadpoint
-datanoderad -datanodecol

New 1.0.0 (17 Jan 2022)
The very first version.
